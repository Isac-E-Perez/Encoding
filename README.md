# Encoding Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented encoding text using Python. I used the libraries tkinter, and base64 which helped me to build the project. The project converts text to random and meaningless text called ciphertext in a process called encoding. The decoding process converts the ciphertext back to the original text.
