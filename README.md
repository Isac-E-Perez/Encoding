# Encoding Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented encoding text using Python. I used the libraries tkinter, and base64 which helped me to build the project. The project converts text to random and meaningless text called ciphertext in a process called encoding. The decoding process converts the ciphertext back to the original text. 

### Results:

First, I created the initialize window for my project.

Afterwards, I created the labels for the user interface app.

Then defined the variables I will use later for the application.

Subsequently, I created the function to encode. The encode function have arguents -key and message.

Then I created the funciton to decode with the arguments - key and message.

I made the function to set mode, which would be either encode or decode.

I then created the function exit and reset window.

Finally, created the labels and buttons for the application.

Finally, I closed the mainloop which is the last command given to compile all the previous commands and displays the window as soon as the program is running.
